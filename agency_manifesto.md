### **InterviewBot Agency Manifesto**

#### **Mission:**

To transform and enhance the technical interview process by harnessing a multi-agent AI system that interacts adaptively with developer candidates, delivering real-time feedback and data-driven assessment. Through the Agency Swarm framework, InterviewBot dynamically conducts technical interviews, using scoring, evaluation, and knowledge retrieval to measure candidate proficiency effectively.

#### **Goals:**

1. **Conduct Adaptive Technical Interviews:**
   * Cover key technical areas, including Python, API integration, cloud architecture, containerization, and the Agency Swarm framework.
   * Prompt candidates with tailored follow-up questions immediately upon response and allow them the flexibility to skip questions as needed.
2. **Reference and Retrieve Documentation:**
   * Use relevant documentation to support questions and provide clarifications on technical topics to enhance the interview experience.
   * Automate documentation look-up for any interview topics that require in-depth information to prevent interruptions and sustain engagement.
3. **Automate Candidate Scoring and Assessment:**
   * Automatically record, analyze, and score candidate responses according to predefined rubrics.
   * Store response data for easy reference, tracking, and review in post-interview analysis.
4. **Deliver Feedback and Post-Interview Reports:**
   * Provide a real-time evaluation summary using scoring rubrics for key skill areas.
   * Leverage `FeedbackAnalyzer` for a comprehensive overview that includes strengths, areas for improvement, and recommendations.
5. **User-Friendly Gradio Interface:**
   * Use the Gradio interface to create an accessible and seamless interaction space for candidates to submit answers, request information, and receive immediate feedback.
